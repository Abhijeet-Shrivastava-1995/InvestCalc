Greetings

This project is a simple form which takes three parameters<br />
1-->Date<br />
2-->Amount<br />
3-->Fund Name<br />

This form is first of all helpful for those who invest their money time to time in some or the other funds. <br />
Anyone who wants to quickly check their current worth of investment can use this form.<br />
<strong><bold>Please See:</bold></strong> the fund names I've got over here is of <strong>Axis Mutual Funds.</strong><br />


<italics>Regarding the parameters</italics><br />
the date will be the one when you made the investment.<br />
the amount will be your money you invested on the date of investment<br />
the fund name will obviously the scheme name
